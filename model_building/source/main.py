"""
Salary Prediction Model Using Random Forest

This script builds and evaluates a Random Forest regression model to predict salaries based on job title, state, and experience level. 

Workflow:
1. Load the preprocessed dataset from a parquet file.
2. Perform basic data cleaning by dropping missing values.
3. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. Train a RandomForestRegressor model on the training data.
5. Make salary predictions on the test set.
6. Evaluate the model using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (RÂ²) score.
7. Analyze feature importance to determine which factors influence salary the most.
8. Save the trained model as a `.pkl` file for future use.
9. Generate and save a feature importance plot.

Outputs:
- Model evaluation metrics displayed in the console.
- A bar chart of feature importances saved as 'output/feature_importances.png'.
- The trained model saved as 'salary_prediction_model.pkl' in the '../shared' directory.

Dependencies:
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- joblib
- parquet (for reading the dataset)
